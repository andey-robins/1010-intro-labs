A collection of lab materials used in Intro to Computer Science (COSC 1010) at the University of Wyoming for the 22-23 academic school year. Two-hundred and eighteen students were present in the sections of the course throughout the academic year. From student feedback, these labs were a major contributor to their development of skills throughout the semester.

These labs are designed to accomodate the textbook [Think Python 2nd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). Some slight modifications to presentation order were implemented in the course and reflected in the lab assignments. Some markdown syntax are extensions provided by the interface made use of (codio). Depending on your markdown viewer, they may not render properly.

## Assignments

Each lab assignment is sumarized in short below.

### Lab 1

A simple hello world lab, this introduces students to running code using python and the ecosystem they'll work in all semester.

### Lab 2

This lab tasks students with creating some of the calculation logic for a checkout counter application.

### Lab 3

This lab asks students to count the number of steps needed to show that an integer satisfies the collatz conjecture.

### Lab 4

This lab asks students to implement the logic for determining the winner of a game of rock-paper-scissors and finishing the CLI logic to play the game.

### Lab 5

This lab asks students to write an application which translates simple sentences from English to the conlang _toki pona_.

### Lab 6

This lab asks students to write code which is able to perform simple analysis over input data.

### Lab 7

This lab asks students to identify the most common words in movie scripts.

### Lab 8

This lab extends lab 7 by asking for more analysis over the frequency analysis of movie word scripts.

### Lab 9

This lab extends lab 8 by having students visualize their findings from the previous labs with pyplot.

### Lab 10

This lab asks students to debug a somewhat complicated piece of software for playing the game yacht dice.
