A collection of lab materials used in Intro to Computer Science (COSC 1010) at the University of Wyoming for the 22-23 academic school year. Two-hundred and eighteen students were present in the sections of the course throughout the academic year. From student feedback, these labs were a major contributor to their development of skills throughout the semester.

These labs are designed to accomodate the textbook [Think Python 2nd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). Some slight modifications to presentation order were implemented in the course and reflected in the lab assignments.
