# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Today you'll be writing a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors that can be played against the computer. Portions of the code have been already developed for you, so your task will be to fill in the missing sections to make the code functional.

A quick reminder on the rules of RPS:
1. Each player chooses either "Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors"
2. The player's choices are compared. If they're the same, the game is a draw.
3. If they're different:
 - Rock beats Scissors
 - Scissors beats Paper
 - Paper beats Rock
